# Abstract Syntax Tree 

This program is just a test project for me to write down
things I am learning while I study compiler design. I still have a long way to go.


To use this program first type

$ make flex

Then 

$ make

then to compile example source file .exp

$ make -f Makefile.test

then you can run the demo or checkout output.c
